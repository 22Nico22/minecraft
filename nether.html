          <h1>Nether</h1>
          <p>
            The Nether is a dangerous and hostile dimension in Minecraft, often
            described as a hell-like underworld. It is filled with lava, fire,
            aggressive mobs, and unique blocks that cannot be found in the
            Overworld.
          </p>
          <h2>Creation</h2>
          <p>
            The Nether is not generated when a new world is created. It is only
            generated when a player enters it for the first time through a
            Nether portal built from obsidian and activated with fire.
          </p>

            <h2>Environment</h2>
            <div id="nether_environment_img">
              <img src="kepek/nether/nether.gif" alt="Nether portal gif" />
            </div>
            <p>
              The Nether has no daylight cycle and no natural sky. Time passes
              normally, but the environment remains permanently dark and
              hostile. The dimension is illuminated mainly by lava, fire, and
              glowing blocks such as glowstone and shroomlights. Water cannot
              exist in the Nether and evaporates instantly, making survival more
              difficult. The terrain is highly vertical, with floating islands,
              deep lava oceans, and narrow bridges of netherrack, forcing
              players to move carefully. Many dangerous mobs inhabit the Nether,
              including Ghasts, Piglins, Hoglins, Blazes, and Magma Cubes, each
              adding to the overall danger of the dimension.

          <h1>The Nether Biomes</h1>
          <p>
            The Nether is made up of several unique biomes, each with its own
            atmosphere, terrain, and resources. These biomes create a varied and
            dangerous environment that makes exploration both challenging and
            rewarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Nether biomes can be seen on the image above, including areas
            such as the Crimson Forest, Warped Forest, Soul Sand Valley, and
            Basalt Deltas. Each biome has distinct colors, blocks, and mobs that
            define its character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some important structures also generate within these biomes, most
            notably the Nether Fortress. Nether Fortresses are essential for
            progression, as they are the only natural source of Blaze Rods and
            Nether Wart.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
          <h1>Nether Generation</h1>
          <p>
            The layout of biomes and structures in the Nether is determined by
            the world seed. Using the same seed will result in the same biome
            placement and fortress locations across different worlds.
